The article "Motivation Outcomes in Math-related Videogames" by Hoffman et al. (2020) examines the impact of playing math-related video games on motivation outcomes. The study involved middle school students playing three different types of math-related video games and completing surveys to assess their motivation towards math. The results showed that the students who played the games had increased intrinsic motivation towards math and higher self-efficacy beliefs. Additionally, the study found that the type of game design influenced motivation outcomes, with games that emphasized problem-solving and exploration leading to greater motivation outcomes than games that focused solely on math facts. Overall, the study suggests that math-related video games have the potential to positively impact motivation outcomes among students.
The article "Effects of a Videogame in Math Performance and Anxiety in Primary School" by Rocha and Dondio (2021) examines the impact of a math-related video game on math performance and anxiety in primary school students. The study involved a group of 53 students who played a math-related video game over the course of six weeks, with their math performance and anxiety levels measured before and after the intervention. The results showed that playing the video game had a positive impact on math performance, with the students showing significant improvement in their math scores. Additionally, the study found that playing the game had a positive effect on reducing math anxiety among the students. The authors suggest that incorporating math-related video games in primary school education could be an effective way to improve math performance and reduce math anxiety.
