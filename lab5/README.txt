Question:

Another legal XML tag not used in this lab is the "stand-alone" tag. This kind of tag combines both a start-tag and end-tag in one. It is identified with a '/' (slash) preceding the final >. (For example, the <foo/> is a stand-alone tag that is "self balancing".

Describe briefly how you would modify Requirement 1 to allow this kind of tag.

Answer:

To check for a stand-alone tag I can add an if statement where it will check to see if there is a "/" after the characters or if it is an alphabet. If there is a "/" then it is a stand-alone tag if not it is not a stand-alone tag.
